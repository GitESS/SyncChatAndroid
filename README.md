**Sync Chat**
=========

Sync Chat is a chatting application based on Xmpp.
This is a test application for Sync Enabled Vehicles. 

The basic idea behind this application is : people using sync on there vehicle can chat to each other  without typing , or we can say without avoiding road safety rules :D.

For this application we had faced some difficulties  :

 - Xmpp Protocols
 - Android 
 - Sync Applink
 - Caffeine overdose :)


This is test Application nothing fancy is happening here, But if you are really interested then below are the some so called functionality we had covered :

 - Single chat
 - Group chat
 - Group creation
 - Sync Enabled
 - Voice Messaging

Thanks.
